Honestly, I'm not too sure the purpose of this mod. I want to add a few Bri'ish recipes since I noticed Pam's HarvestCraft is very US-centric. Inspired by mods like Create Mod, Mekanism and Immersive Engineering, I also want to make a full production chain and a fully fledged recipe and tag system. Ideally recipes will ask not for an item, but a tag which describes the items use in that recipe? Eggs? You mean... emulsifier!

# Name
I'm still unsure of a name for this mod.

# Notes
Some of the recipes in this mod require other mods, but none in particular.
For example: The metal can recipe requires items which match forge:plates/tin, forge:plates/steel or forge:plates/aluminum.
This means that if you have a mod which adds tin plates, steel plates or aluminum plates, you can use those in the recipe. Otherwise, you will be unable to craft the metal ca n. To make up for this, I plan to include the can in certain loot tables, such as dungeon chests, mineshaft chests, etc.
