Honestly, I'm not too sure the purpose of this mod. I want to add a few Bri'ish recipes since I noticed Pam's HarvestCraft is very US-centric. Inspired by mods like Create Mod, Mekanism and Immersive Engineering, I also want to make a full production chain and a fully fledged recipe and tag system. Ideally recipes will ask not for an item, but a tag which describes the items use in that recipe? Eggs? You mean... emulsifier!
