Artwork:

Some of this artwork was produced using OpenAI's DALL-E. Now, I'm not a fan of AI
generated artwork for paid projects, but I think it's a great tool for free projects
that might not have the resources to create their own artwork, or pay for a real artist.
I do not promote the use of AI generated artwork in situations where an artist could be
paid for their work. However, this project is intended for my to play around with Forge
Modding, and as an educational tool for myself, therefore, I wanted to keep the cost down
to a minimum. I do not intend to make any money off of this project, and I do not intend
to use this project to promote any other projects that I may be working on. Therefore,
I believe that the use of AI generated artwork is acceptable in this situation.

I would love to replace the artwork with a real artist's work one day. If this project
ever gets to the stage where I think it's more than an educational tool for myself. I
will be sure to replace the artwork with real artwork, and I will be sure to pay the
artist for their work. I will also be sure to remove any AI generated artwork from the
project at that time. Thank you for your understanding.

For the sake of transparency, I will be sure to include a list of all the AI generated
artwork that I use in this project;

 - all the cooked and uncooked sausage textures, except sosig.png

Minecraft Forge: Credits/Thank You

Forge is a set of tools and modifications to the Minecraft base game code to assist 
mod developers in creating new and exciting content. It has been in development for 
several years now, but I would like to take this time thank a few people who have 
helped it along it's way.

First, the people who originally created the Forge projects way back in Minecraft 
alpha. Eloraam of RedPower, and SpaceToad of Buildcraft, without their acceptiance 
of me taking over the project, who knows what Minecraft modding would be today.

Secondly, someone who has worked with me, and developed some of the core features
that allow modding to be as functional, and as simple as it is, cpw. For developing
FML, which stabelized the client and server modding ecosystem. As well as the base
loading system that allows us to modify Minecraft's code as elegently as possible.

Mezz, who has stepped up as the issue and pull request manager. Helping to keep me
sane as well as guiding the community into creating better additions to Forge.

Searge, Bspks, Fesh0r, ProfMobious, and all the rest over on the MCP team {of which 
I am a part}. For creating some of the core tools needed to make Minecraft modding 
both possible, and as stable as can be.
  On that note, here is some specific information of the MCP data we use:
    * Minecraft Coder Pack (MCP) *
      Forge Mod Loader and Minecraft Forge have permission to distribute and automatically 
      download components of MCP and distribute MCP data files. This permission is not 
      transitive and others wishing to redistribute the Minecraft Forge source independently
      should seek permission of MCP or remove the MCP data files and request their users 
      to download MCP separately.
      
And lastly, the countless community members who have spent time submitting bug reports, 
pull requests, and just helping out the community in general. Thank you.
